Some things to do if we're bored at the end:

Game.java: 
  - terminalTest method make more efficient by excluding impossible moves in the check?

Make interfaces such that this formal model can be adapted to other games 

Hashing optimizations?

Update formatting (curly braces mainly)
  - also apply the Game.java formatting to the other classes

Multithreading/GUI lol?

Test a bunch of heuristics to see what works best?
  - play ai vs ai with different heuristics to see who wins lol
