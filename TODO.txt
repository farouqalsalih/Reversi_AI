Some things to do if we're bored at the end:

Make interfaces such that this formal model can be adapted to other games 

Hashing optimizations?

Update formatting (curly braces mainly)
  - also apply the Game.java formatting to the other classes

Multithreading/GUI?

Test a bunch of heuristics to see what works best?
  - play ai vs ai with different heuristics to see who wins
