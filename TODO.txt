Some things to do if we're bored at the end:

Game.java: 
  - terminalTest method make more efficient by excluding impossible moves in the check?

Make interfaces such that this formal model can be adapted to other games 

Hashing optimizations?

Update formatting (curly braces mainly)
  - also apply the Game.java formatting to the other classes
